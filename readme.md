## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You'll be greeted with a clean, intuitive interface that's easy to navigate.

## Features

- **Date of Birth Input**: Users can input their date of birth using a date picker. This ensures accuracy and ease of use.
- **Time Passed Display**: The application calculates and displays the amount of time that has passed since the entered date of birth in various units. The units used are years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Dynamic Update**: The time passed is dynamically updated and displayed on the page. This means you can see your time ticking away in real-time!

## Code Structure

The main HTML structure of the application is as follows:

- A `div` with class `background` that serves as the main container for the application.
- Inside the `background` div, there are three main `div` elements:
  - `intialText`: This div contains a heading prompting the user to enter their date of birth.
  - `afterDOBButton`: This div contains the display for the time passed since the entered date of birth.
  - `settings`: This div contains the settings for the application, including the date input and button for adding the date of birth.
